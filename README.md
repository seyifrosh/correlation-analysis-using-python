DELIVERABLES


1)Organize information using Basic python structures

2)Determine if there are regional differences in the real- estate markets.

3)Inspect Southern Brasil to see if there is  arelationship between home size and price.


DATASET:

The dataset used for this project is a real-estate dataset of homes for sale in Brasil, it was collected in 2015-2016 period.


OVERVIEW

The dataset used for this project came in two different csv files. The datasets were imported seperately,cleaned and combined into a single dataframe.Data visualization such as scatterplots,box plots, histogram and barcharts were used to learn about the distribution of the dataset as well as learning about the regional differences in the dataset.Karl Pearson correlation coefficient was computed to study the kind of relationship that existed between sizes and prices of houses in the states of the southern region of Brasil.

KEY INSIGHTS

The mean area [sq meters] of houses in Brasil was 115.020224 and the median was 103.000000

The mean price [USD] of houses in Brasil was 194987.315515 and the median was 165697.555000

The prices of houses is skewed to the right(positively skewed) with most of the house prices falling between 100,000 and 300,000 us dollars

The southern region has the most expensive properties in Brasil (averagely 209,000 us dollars).This aligns with the 2020 rank of regions with highest GDP in Brasil (verified)
